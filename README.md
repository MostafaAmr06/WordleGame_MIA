# WordleGame_MIA

A Wordle game I made in Python for MIA task (hello MIA!!!). Wordle is that word guessing game where you have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word.

## How to Run

Just run this in your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
or run the python file (main.py)


## Controls

- **Type letters** - Use your keyboard
- **Click keys** - Use the virtual keyboard on screen
- **Enter** - Submit your guess
- **Backspace** - Delete a letter
- **New Game** - Start a fresh game

## Files

- `main.py` - Starts the game
- `data/gui.py` - The game window and buttons
- `data/backend.py` - The game rules and word checking
- `data/words.txt` - List of 5-letter words

## Possible Errors

- The file may not launch if you haven't installed python
- all libs are build-in, no need to install anything using pip install
